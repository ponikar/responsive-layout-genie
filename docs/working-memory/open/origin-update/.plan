# Feature: Origin Update

## Overview
- **Purpose**: Update asset positioning when origin point changes to maintain visual position
- **Type**: Enhancement
- **Priority**: High

## Requirements
- When origin point is changed:
  1. The position values REMAIN THE SAME
  2. Only the reference point on the image changes (where we measure position from)
  3. This causes the image to shift visually because we're measuring from a different point
- Example:
  ```
  Initial:
  - Image position: (0,0)
  - Origin: (0.5, 0.5) [center]
  - Visual result: Image's center is at container's (0,0)

  After origin change to (0,0) [top-left]:
  - Image position: STAYS at (0,0)
  - Origin: (0,0) [top-left]
  - Visual result: Image's top-left is at container's (0,0)
  ```
- Same behavior for asset references:
  - Position values are relative to reference asset
  - Position values stay same when origin changes
  - Only the reference point on the image changes
- Changes should cascade to dependent assets

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Analyze current origin point calculation and positioning logic
- [x] Design origin update algorithm:
  ```typescript
  // When origin changes
  // No position compensation needed!
  // Just update the origin and let the rendering handle the visual change
  newPosition = oldPosition // stays the same
  ```
- [x] Found issue: Konva Image offsetX/offsetY props are hardcoded to center
  ```typescript
  // Current (incorrect):
  <Image
    offsetX={width / 2}  // Always centers
    offsetY={height / 2} // Always centers
  />
  
  // Should be:
  <Image
    offsetX={width * transform.origin.x}  // Uses origin from transform
    offsetY={height * transform.origin.y} // Uses origin from transform
  />
  ```
- [x] Implement fix in Canvas.tsx:
  - [x] Update Image component to use transform.origin for offsets
  - [ ] Verify position values stay same during origin changes
  - [ ] Test with different origin values
- [ ] Test with scenarios:
  - [ ] Container-referenced asset: origin center to top-left (position should stay same)
  - [ ] Asset-referenced asset: origin center to top-left (position should stay same)
  - [ ] Nested references: verify visual positions update correctly
  - [ ] Different scale modes remain consistent
  - [ ] Both portrait/landscape orientations

## Technical Considerations
- Position values should NOT change when origin changes
- Visual position changes are handled by Konva's offsetX/offsetY props
- Asset reference positions follow same principle
- Scale modes and orientations don't affect this behavior
