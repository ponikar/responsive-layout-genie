# Feature: Orientation Copy

## Overview
- **Purpose**: Allow copying of container and asset properties between portrait and landscape orientations
- **Type**: Enhancement
- **Priority**: Medium

## Requirements
- [x] Add ability to copy container properties from portrait to landscape
- [x] Add ability to copy container properties from landscape to portrait
- [x] Add ability to copy asset properties from portrait to landscape
- [x] Add ability to copy asset properties from landscape to portrait
- [x] Ensure proper handling of parent-child relationships during copy
- [x] Add UI controls for orientation copy operations

## Implementation Plan
1. [x] Add new functions to layoutStore
   - [x] copyOrientationToLandscape(containerId: string)
   - [x] copyOrientationToPortrait(containerId: string)
   - [x] Implementation should recursively handle child containers and assets

2. [x] Update PropertiesPanel UI
   - [x] Add copy orientation controls in ContainerProperties component
   - [x] Add warning dialog for overwriting existing customizations
   - [x] Integrate with undo/redo functionality

3. [x] Add validation and error handling
   - [x] Validate container bounds after copy
   - [x] Handle locked containers/assets
   - [x] Add error messages for invalid operations

4. [x] Improve UI Visibility
   - [x] Move copy buttons to their respective sections
   - [x] Make buttons more prominent and contextual
   - [x] Add clear labels and icons

5. [ ] Testing
   - [ ] Test with nested containers
   - [ ] Test with various asset configurations
   - [ ] Verify undo/redo functionality

## Technical Considerations
- Need to handle nested container hierarchies
- Consider relative vs absolute positioning during copy
- Handle asset scale modes and transformations
- Integrate with existing undo/redo system
- No need for preview functionality
- No need to recalculate asset scale modes
- Copy exact values between orientations
